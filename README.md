# NoteNook

## What it will do?
- **NoteNook** serves as a song library for you to listen in 
to all your favorite songs from various genres and cultures
at nook and crannies of buildings.

## Who will it be for?

- The targeted users are for people who listen to *music*.

## Why?

- This Project interests me because I've recently discovered my hobby of singing and listening to music. As someone 
who really enjoys listening to music either it be when I'm studying or when I'm going home from a tiring day in University,
a song library would make it much easier to keep note of songs I like offline.

## User Stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to add **songs** to my *playlists*.
- As a user, I want to be able to **remove** songs from the *playlists*.
- As a user, I want to be able to view my songs in the *playlists*.
- As a user, I want to be able to **play** my song Library.
- As a user, I want to be able to **randomize** the songs that I play.
- As a user, when I select the quit option, i want to be reminded to be able to save my song library.
- As a user, when I start the application, I want to be given the option to load my song library.
