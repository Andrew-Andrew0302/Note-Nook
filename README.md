# NoteNook

## What it will do?
- **NoteNook** serves as a song library for you to listen in 
to all your favorite songs from various genres and cultures
at nook and crannies of buildings.

## Who will it be for?

- The targeted users are for people who listen to *music*.

## Why?

- This Project interests me because I've recently discovered my hobby of singing and listening to music. As someone 
who really enjoys listening to music either it be when I'm studying or when I'm going home from a tiring day in University,
a song library would make it much easier to keep note of songs I like offline.

## User Stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to add **songs** to my *playlists*.
- As a user, I want to be able to make an arbitrary number of *playlists*.
- As a user, I want to be able to view my songs in the *playlists*.
- As a user, I want to be able to **shuffle** through my *playlist*.
- As a user, I want to be able to **replay** my songs on a *loop*.
- As a user, I want to be able to **Queue** whichever songs I want in any particular order.
